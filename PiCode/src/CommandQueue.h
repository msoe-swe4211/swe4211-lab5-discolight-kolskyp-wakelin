 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * Function prototypes and class definitions for the command queue class.
 * This class, the CommandQueue, allows a user to enque a set of commands for a device. The commands must be sinple integers,
 * but they can have bitmapped representations.  The queue can hold as many items as is necessary.
